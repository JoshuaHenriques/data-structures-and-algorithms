# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

*Example 1:*

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

*Example 2:*

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

*Constraints:*

```
1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
```

## Naive Solution

### Approach
Use a hashmap to have the distance as the key and the value be an array storing all points on the graph with that distance from the origin. Sort the keys and iterate through them slicing at k and append/extending that list to the result list and then return the result array also slicing at length k.

### Complexity
$$Time: O(nlogn)$$

$$Space: O(n)$$

### Code
```
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    hashmap = defaultdict(list)

    for x, y in points:
        hashmap[cc].append((x, y))

    result = []

    for key in sorted(list(hashmap.keys()))[:k]:
        result.extend(hashmap[key])

    return result[:k]
```

## Optimized Solution

### Approach
Using a minheap we can append an array to it (the first element will be the key when heapified), [distance, x, y], then we heapify it. We loop through k and just pop the values while decrementing k and appending the cords to the result array.

### Complexity
$$Time: O(klogn)$$

$$Space: O(n)$$

### Code
```
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    result = []
    minHeap = []

    for x, y in points:
        dist = sqrt((x - 0)**2 + (y - 0)**2)
        minHeap.append([dist, x, y])

    heapq.heapify(minHeap)

    while k > 0:
        dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        result.append([x, y])
        k -= 1

    return result
```
