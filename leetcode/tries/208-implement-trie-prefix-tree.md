# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:
* Trie() Initializes the trie object.
* void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
* boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
* boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

*Example 1:*

```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

*Constraints:*

```
1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000
word and prefix consist only of lowercase English letters.
At most 3 * 104 calls in total will be made to insert, search, and startsWith.
```

## Solution

### Approach
A TrieNode needs a dictionary(hashmap) to store the children, up to 26 characters, and a boolean that indicates we're at the end of a word on the path. 

To insert a word we use a curr variable initialized to root and for each character in word if it's not a child of curr we then add it as a key and instantiate a TrieNode as the value and then we update the curr pointer to that child. Update that curr's isEndOfWord variable to True.

To Search is similar but return false if the character is not a child of the current not and if we get through the for loop we return the isEndOfWord boolean

Starts with function is the same as the search function
### Complexity
$$Time: O(n)$$

$$Space: O(1)$$

### Code
```
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.isEndOfWord = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        curr = self.root

        for char in word:
            if char not in curr.children:
                curr.children[char] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[char]
        
        curr.isEndOfWord = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root

        for char in word:
            if char not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[char]

        return curr.isEndOfWord
        

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root

        for char in prefix:
            if char not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[char]

        return True
```
