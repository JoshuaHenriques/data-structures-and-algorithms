# 525. Contiguous Array

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

*Example 1:*

```txt
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
```

*Example 2:*

```txt
Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

*Constraints:*

```txt
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```
