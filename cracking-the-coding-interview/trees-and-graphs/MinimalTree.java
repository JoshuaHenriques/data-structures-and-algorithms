/*
Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an
algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

Input: [3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14]
Output: 

Hints: 
19. A minimal binary tree has about the same number of nodes on the left of each
    node as on the right. Let's focus on just the root for now. How would you
    ensure that about the same number of nodes are on the left of the root as
   	on the right? 

73. You could implement this by finding the "ideal" next element to add and
    repeatedly calling insertValue. This will be a bit inefficient, as you
    would have to repeatedly traverse the tree. Try recursion instead. Can you
    divide this problem into subproblems?

116. Imagine we had a createMinimalTree method that returns a minimal tree for a
     given array (but for some strange reason doesn't operate on the root of the
     tree). Could you use this to operate on the root of the tree? Could you
     write the base case for the function? Great? Thien that's basically the
     entire function.
