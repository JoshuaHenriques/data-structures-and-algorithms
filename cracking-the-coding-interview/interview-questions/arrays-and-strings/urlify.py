#3 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You many assume
that the string has sufficent space at the end to hold the additional
characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Notes: If
implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this
operation in place.) 

Examples:
Input:		"Mr John Smith		", 13
Output:		"Mr%20John%20Smith"
